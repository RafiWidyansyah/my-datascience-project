# Background

  GoodThought NGO has been a catalyst for positive change, focusing its efforts on education, healthcare, and sustainable development to make a significant difference in communities worldwide. 
With this mission, GoodThought has orchestrated an array of assignments aimed at uplifting underprivileged populations and fostering long-term growth. This project offers a hands-on opportunity to explore how data-driven insights can direct and enhance these humanitarian efforts.
