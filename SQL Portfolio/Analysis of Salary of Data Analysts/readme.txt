This project, a component of MySkill Learning Portfolio Project, explored the realm of SQL, with a specific focus on its practical application with real-world data. 
I acquired a thorough understanding of WHERE queries, aggregate functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), subqueries, and stored procedures. 
This material serves as an invaluable resource for enhancing my SQL proficiency through a comprehensive set of exercises and challenges, 
ranging from fundamental to intricate queries.
