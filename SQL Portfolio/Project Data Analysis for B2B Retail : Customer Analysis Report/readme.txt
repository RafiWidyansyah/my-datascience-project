Here are the things to be reviewed:

- How is the current sales growth?
- Is the number of customers on xyz.com increasing?
- How many of these customers have made transactions?
- Which product categories are most popular among customers?
- How many customers remain active in making transactions?

Conclusion :
1. The performance of xyz.com took a significant hit in the second quarter, evident from the substantial drop in sales value and revenue, which plummeted by 20% and 24%, respectively. Moreover, the acquisition of new customers also declined, falling slightly compared to the previous quarter.

2. The interest of new customers in shopping at xyz.com remains a concern. Only about 56% of them have made transactions. To address this issue, the Product team has been advised to conduct a thorough analysis of customer behaviour and make necessary improvements to enhance the conversion rate (register to transaction).

3. Product categories S18 and S24 collectively contribute around 50% of total orders and 60% of total sales. Therefore, xyz.com should prioritise the development and growth of these categories.

4. The retention rate of xyz.com customers is also quite low, standing at only 24%. This indicates that many customers who made transactions in the first quarter did not return to make repeat orders in the second quarter.

5. Consequently, xyz.com experienced negative growth in the second quarter and requires substantial improvements in both product offerings and marketing strategies to achieve its targets and achieve positive growth in the subsequent quarter.

6. Low retention rates and conversion rates can serve as early indicators that customers may not be interested, satisfied, or disappointed with their shopping experience at xyz.com.
